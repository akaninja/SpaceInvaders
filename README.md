# Space Invaders

This is my take on a Space Invaders like game... A work in progress... I'm learning C# in Unity so I decided to make my own version of a simple game. I had thought of a variation of Space Invaders for a class exercise and figured I could try to build it... maybe... I'll share my code here as it is developed. Right now I only have a tank (the player) and the alien squad coming down on us.
